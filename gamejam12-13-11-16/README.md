Lincoln School of Computer Science Game Jam 11/16
Ran over the 12 and 13 of November 2016
24hrs to make a game which matched the theme of "RGB"
Modifiers were: 360, mobile, 8 bit, under 20mb
I made a GBA game.
Originally flappybird clone, then pacman, finally breakout after images didn't work.
Tested using visual boy advance 1.8.0
What I learned:
-C is terrible.
-GBA dev is not worth it.
-Learn C before going further as 99% of what was going on went over my head.

Final Product:
-Quirky Breakout Game that needs you to be on the ball the moment you open it.

Improvements:
-Menu
-End States
